# Image Classification with CNN

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using a dataset of images categorized into various classes. The project demonstrates how to preprocess image data, build a CNN model, train the model, and evaluate its performance. Additionally, it showcases the capability to predict the class of new unseen images.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to classify images using a CNN model. The dataset contains images from different classes, and the CNN is trained to accurately identify and categorize these images. The project also includes testing the model's predictions on new data.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is a multi-class image dataset consisting of different categories like 'Bird', 'Car', etc.
- Images are resized to 32x32 pixels and normalized for optimal training.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model comprises:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input images.
- **Max Pooling Layers**: Reduce the dimensionality of feature maps.
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.
- **Dense Layers**: Perform final classification based on extracted features.

## Setup and Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

Additional libraries like `sklearn` are required for data splitting and evaluation.

## Data Preprocessing
- Images are normalized to a scale of [0, 1].
- Training and testing datasets are split into 80% training and 20% validation.
- Data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping) are applied to enhance model generalization.

## Training the Model
- The model is compiled using the **Adam** optimizer and **categorical cross-entropy** as the loss function.
- Accuracy is used as the primary evaluation metric.
- The model is trained over a set number of epochs with a defined batch size.
- Training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to observe the learning progress.

## Evaluation and Results
- The trained model's performance is evaluated on the validation set using metrics like accuracy.
- A confusion matrix is generated to visualize classification accuracy across different classes.
- The final accuracy achieved is satisfactory for the given dataset.

## Prediction on New Data
- The project includes functionality to predict new images:
  1. Load and preprocess a new image.
  2. Use the trained CNN model to predict the class.
  3. Display the predicted class.

## Future Improvements
- Use a larger and more diverse dataset to improve model robustness.
- Experiment with different CNN architectures for better accuracy.
- Implement a web interface for easy image upload and classification.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
